## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- `strict mode` helps write cleaner code and catch silent errors.
- Functions can be declared, expressed, arrowed, and nested – all with distinct behaviors.
- Arrays and objects are foundational data structures—understanding mutation, access, and methods is essential.
- Iteration (especially `for` and `while`) unlocks dynamic data manipulation.
